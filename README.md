# [Infinify](http://martijnschipper.com/portfolio/detail/44) - Spotify application

In year one we had to make an application for the fresh new Spotify API. Together with a classmate we made Infinify. The Infinify app grabs the similiar artists to what your are currently listning from last.fm and generates a fresh playlist for you. It also contained a picture collage with pictures from last.fm and more info and albums from the artist currently playing. Most of it is written in Javascript together with the spotify API.

I made this project together with: Bas van Manen

Take the code and use as help and example as you wish!


## Notes

- Change 'YOURAPIKEYHERE' on line 422 of logic.js to you [last.fm api key](http://www.last.fm/api)

## Installation Mac

- Make the folder ~/Spotify
- Put the folder infinify in the there, so you have ~/Spotify/infinify/*code files*/
- In Spotify type in the search bar, spotify:app:infinify
- The app should start, if not make sure the files are in the right place and your have a Spotify dev account.

## Installation Windows

Same idea as make, for details visit [Spotify dev site](https://developer.spotify.com/)
